# C Program using Parallel Arrays and Loops to Calculate Catered Meal Sales and Charitable Donation
I used at least two different arrays to manage the meal sales, effectively implementing parallel arrays:

One array for Adult Meals
One array for Child Meals
I utilized a "for" loop to process each array.

The program calculated the totals in dollar amounts for:

Adult Meal costs
Child Meal costs
Additionally, it calculated the overall totals by combining all categories.

For the percentage calculation of the total categories, I chose to use a 45% amount for the program outcome.

Here's a summary of the implementation details and results:

Catered meal prices were set with adult meals priced at $10 each.
The program allowed setting the number of adult and child meals sold in each category. For example, I set 3 adult meals sold for a certain category.
At the end, the program printed out:

The total dollar amount spent on sales for Adult Meals
The total dollar amount spent on sales for Child Meals
The overall total amount spent
The percentage amount (45% in this case) calculated for charitable donation purposes
This implementation ensured a clear and organized calculation of meal sales and donations.

Here is a screenshot on the output:
